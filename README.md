NOTE: Due to my lack of understanding of where ASYNC would really be useful here. I am continuing the studies and completed this as is. It works, it just needs refreshing. Also no JEST unit testing. I'll consider recreating this in REACT.JS after passing that section of studies. I feel like with my level of knowledge, i'd just recreate this in a month anyways.
